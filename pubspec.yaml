# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
# flutter:
# This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
# The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
# which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
# using method channels.
# The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
# This is required for using method channels on Android.
# The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
# This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
# All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
# adding or updating assets for this project.
# plugin:
#   platforms:
#     android:
#       package: dev.cozy_data.cozy_data
#       pluginClass: CozyDataPlugin
#     ios:
#       pluginClass: CozyDataPlugin
#     linux:
#       pluginClass: CozyDataPlugin
#     macos:
#       pluginClass: CozyDataPlugin
#     windows:
#       pluginClass: CozyDataPluginCApi
#     web:
#       pluginClass: CozyDataWeb
#       fileName: cozy_data_web.dart

# To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

# To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
# fonts:
#   - family: Schyler
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#         style: italic
#   - family: Trajan Pro
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
#
# For details regarding fonts in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
